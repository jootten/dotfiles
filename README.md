# Dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles. Work is still in progress. Use only as inspiration. :grin:

## Highlights
* Fully fledged Neovim configuration with many useful plugins, keybindings and autocompletion. Optimized for Python development.
* Low-level XKeymap that allows to fully utilize ijkl as arrow keys and uo as home/end when holding caps lock (only in US layout).
